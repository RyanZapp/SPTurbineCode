# SPTurbineCode
Using this Github repo to possibly store any code we want to use


There will be a main "call" function outside of any folders

* The airfoils file is where we store all of the airfoil dat files

* The Qblade Input Files is where we store all of the files output from the matlab code that will
be used as inputs into Qblade

* The src code is where we store all of the code that is called in the main "call" function
