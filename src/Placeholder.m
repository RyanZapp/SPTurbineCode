% set modulus of elasticity
% Set modulus of rigidity
% Set each of the input and output paths
% Make sure the mathematica code has been run and is ready to go
% Then run the Bladestruct function (see if it automatically runs the
% Bladeshape file, since the Bladeshape file is referenced by the

% Once Bladestruct is done, you will tun TubeStruct function
% Then you will run GuyCablestruct function
